# Zero-Runtime CSS in JS

Linaria lets you write CSS in JS and get real CSS files during build. Use dynamic prop based styles with the React bindings and have them transpiled to CSS variables automatically. Great productivity with source maps and linting support.

<Button as={Link} to="basics">Read basics</Button>
